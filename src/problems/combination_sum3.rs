    brainstorming...

    need a number to add to get to sum...

    how do I keep track of partial sums? What if some partial sums already have answers (that we possibly computed once before) â€“ is that something that would mean anything for this problem?

    how would I do this manually? Need to think with a more concrete example...

    k = 2, n = 4

    x + y = 4 (want all distinct (x, y) pairs that satisfy this equation... -- we have k = 2 variables denoted with x and y here)
    y = 4 - x
    x = 4 - y

    We can simply iterate over 1 to n
    y = 3, 2, 1 (when x = 1, 2, 3)
    x = 3, 2, 1... same...

    hm... let's try a bigger example, to not get confused by only 2 variables...

    k = 3, n = 9
    x + y + z = 9
    x = 9 - y - z

    Simplest solution would be to have two nested loops (three loops total), and keep checking the sums.
    Then there would be a problem of duplicate tuples, so convert to string, sort topologically, and store in HS
